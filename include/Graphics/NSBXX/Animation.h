// Used to reference some kind of animation, specifically the innermost part
// of the NSBxx files. For example in a .nsbca file, the header has signature
// BCA0, the first file within this has signature JNT0, and the objects within
// that have signature J.AC (. = 0x00), and this struct references the J.AC object.
// Also known to be used for M.AM, M.AT, M.PT. Theoretically usable for something
// of form V.AV but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere in practice.
// Note: the V.?? is completely undocumented as far as I know, and the fact it's
// called V.AV just comes from looking at 0x020f1ca8 in the binary (USA)

    // Each entry combines the following values:
    // bits 0-7: which animation track to use for the relevant thing (material,
    // bone matrix etc). That is, entries[x] = y if track #y in the animation
    // pertains to {material, bone matrix, ...} #x in the model. However, there
    // seems to be a bug with the J.AC functionality: the function populating
    // this struct (InitializeModelAnimationFromJAC, 020b7840 usa) fills the
    // list with entries[y] = x instead. All other usage of the array is consistent
    // with the previous description. In practice we seem to always have x = y
    // and so this never becomes an issue.
    // bit 8: bool indicating whether this is 'used' / relevant in some way - 
    // the ModelRenderData bitfields get populated based on this
    // bit 9: ???, sometimes tested in conjunction with bit 8 (often things
    // only run if entry & 0x300 == 0x100)
