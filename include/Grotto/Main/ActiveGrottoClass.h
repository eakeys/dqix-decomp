// Very WIP. I think in the USA version, the size of this should be
// 632 (0x278), but I don't know what the last members are for.
// This is stored at offset 0x23EC from the 'zone struct'
// (which I haven't detailed yet but is at location 020FB3F0
// in the USA version, and whose pointer is returned by func_02012fe4). 
// The JPN is 0x20 bytes larger, seemingly because of text buffers being
// different sizes.
// For some hints, look at the function func_020a3a34 (USA). It seems to populate
// this class based on a calling TreasureMapMetadata.
