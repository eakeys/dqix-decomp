// for AllocatorUnion / the signed allocator types, with some auxiliary
// function calls (USA: func_020d970c and func_020d974c) before and after it.
// These mess with the interrupt state and increment/decrement a variable
// at a fixed location - maybe a mutex lock/unlock? Needs more investigation.
